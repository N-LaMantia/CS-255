# CS-255 - Systems Analysis and Design - Project Summary and Reflection

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was the customer asking for a system which included a website design. The system had to do all of the things required in the business design document attached. To sum up, the DriverPass system is a system which houses the ability for a user to sign up for driving lessons, take practice tests on the website, reserve times and dates for practicing in-person driving with an instructor, etc. The customer wanted me to design a system that could do all of that and more, detailed in the documents. 


What did you do particularly well?

I did well at organizing the customers needs and wants, and creating a document to sort that. I created numerous functional and non-functional requirements, many different diagrams in UML such as activity diagrams, a sequence diagram, a class diagram, and a use case diagram. These are all things I did well. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my diagrams. At least some of them did not have the complete functionality I wanted and the customer wanted, which was drilled into me during the presentation. I would revise it by adding some of the functionality. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

By the transcript of the interview that the customer had with a team from my company, I was able to draft and complete business requirements, business process requirements, and system requirements in which came together to create use case diagram(s). These diagrams led to other diagrams such as the activity diagrams which then built the foundation for the system design. The user's needs were considered and applied throughout the system design. It is very important to consider these needs because otherwise, you do not get paid. As well, delivering to the customer something that they don't want will not go over well. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by first drafting out all of the requirements for the software. I would then create multiple diagrams to depict the different aspects in its entirety of the system based on what the user would want from the system and from what the customer needs. In the future, I would implement the ability to understand the customer, ask a lot of questions regarding specifics on requirements and what the customer really needs, and I would use the techniques I have learned in this class to create a successful system design that can be implemented.
