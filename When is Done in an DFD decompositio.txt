When is "Done" in an DFD decomposition? 

Notes: 

All independent components are included in a diagram. Breaking it down any more would lead to coding (to a degree). 

When we can define system requirements through the diagram (the diagram is based on what the user needs). 

When a functional prototype has been defined (model or actual prototype functions). 

When processes are all broken down into one singular process (action).


Criteria (he said good? This is a mix between clarity and completeness), clarity (correct), completeness (correct), scalability.
